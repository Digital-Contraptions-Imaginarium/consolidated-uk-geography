Northern Ireland
================
- Find the Northern Ireland 2011 Census population data by small area (SA) at http://www.nisra.gov.uk/demography/default.asp125.htm and save as the _SAPE\_SA\_01\_12.xls_ file.
- I could not find shapefiles for the NI local government districts, but there are shapefiles for the 2011 Census small areas (SAs) instead at http://www.nisra.gov.uk/geography/SmallAreas.htm , unzip them to the _SA2011\_Esri\_Shapefile_ folder. The SAs do not necessarily nest within the local government districts but a best-fit lookup table can be downloaded from another page http://www.nisra.gov.uk/geography/SOA.htm : _11DC\_Lookup.xls_. Note that the page describes the lookup table as matching super output areas vs the districts, but in reality it matches the small areas and the districts.
