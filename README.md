##Introduction
The UK last census in 2011 was administered by three statistics authorities: one for England and Wales, the [Office for National Statistics](http://www.ons.gov.uk/), one for Scotland, the [National Records for Scotland](http://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/), and one for Northern Ireland, the [Northern Ireland Statistics & Research Agency](http://www.nisra.gov.uk). To help data scientists charge higher fees to their clients, the three bodies published the data that was collected through the census using three different websites, different aggregation models, different formats, different units etc. so that a substantial volume of work is necessary to draw a comprehensive picture of the United Kingdom as a whole.

The scripts in this repository try to start addressing the issue by importing selected data from the three sources into homogeneous, cross-country datasets. Hope you will appreciate the effort and continue it together with me.
