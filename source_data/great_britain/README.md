Great Britain
=============
- In case you did not know, Great Britain is made of England, Scotland and Wales :-) (I've learned that for my [naturalisation test](https://www.gov.uk/life-in-the-uk-test/book-life-in-uk-test) last year)
- Find the 2011 local authority boundaries from the Office for National Statistics' website at https://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/geoportal/catalog/search/resource/details.page?uuid=%7B88D90EC4-C8E0-4432-AD5B-33DE6F5C215B%7D . Download and unzip and you should have a _Local_authority_district_(GB)_2011_Boundaries_(Full_Extent)_ folder. A "generalised, clipped version" is also available at https://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/geoportal/catalog/search/resource/details.page?uuid=%7B405635C9-8AE8-4508-AD66-892BB0691DDA%7D .
